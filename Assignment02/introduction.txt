	HUNT THE WUMPUS INTRODUCTION AND RULES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Congratulations! Through close observations and thorough elimination from a list of 
all the best adventurers throughout the kingdom, you have been selected to take on 
the mission to track and retrieve the kingdoms stolen treasure. The treasure was stolen
by The Wumpus, a big, smelly, and powerful beast that have been ravaging nearby villages
and farms. The wumpus is currently residing in the Cavern of Mysteries made up of many other
small caves, you will travel there, find the treasures and kill the Wumpus. We will be 
providing you with the necessities needed on your adventure (A lantern, a bow, 5 arrows 
and 20 silvers to spend in the shop). We pray for your success brave adventurer.

As you approach the entrance of the cave, you spotted several warning signs which had been 
built by past adventurers and hunter groups that have survived but have not successfully killed 
the Wumpus:

Each time you enter a new cave, you may move or shoot into an adjacent cave which will 
cost a random value of lantern oil between 2 and 4. If you move into a cave that is 
adjoining into a cave that contains a hazard, there are ways to tell if one of the next rooms 
contain a:

Bottomless Pit: The other tunnels will feel drafty.

Super Bats: There will be bat noises as they are very territorial.

Wumpus: The Wumpus smell will alert you as it is too foul to ignore.

The Wumpus is usually asleep and will only wake up if you walk into its lair or miss your shot.
If the Wumpus awaken, there is a 75% chance of it moving on to another adjoining cave or a 25% 
chance of it going back to sleep. If by chance it does move into the cave you are in, you lose, 
as no one can go up face to face against the Wumpus.

Hazards:

Bottomless Pits: Are in 2 of the caves in the cavern, if you fall into one, you die and lose.

Super Bats: Lives in 2 of the caves in the cavern, if you walk into one of the cave they live in, 
they will carry you to a random part of the cavern.

Wumpus: The most dangerous beast throughout the kingdom, recognized as a living legend. If it moves 
into the same cave you are in, you will not be able to escape and become its dinner, no matter 
how fast you are, the Wumpus is always faster. The Wumpus is not affected by the super bats nor 
the bottomless pits.

Lantern Ghost : A vengeful ghost of an adventurer that once died because of the lack of lantern oil 
and has been haunting the wumpus cavern ever since, will steal a random (10 to 18) amount of lantern 
oil from if it is in the same cave as you. Beware, the ghost can travel through the cavern walls and 
is unpredictable.
